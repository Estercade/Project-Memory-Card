# Project Memory Card

This project was made following the instructions and specifications for The Odin Project React Course [Memory Card  project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card).

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a memory game using React to practice using hooks. The application should allow users to play a game in which they click on cards displayed in a randomized order and score points by avoiding cards they previously selected in that round. Card order should be randomized every time a card is selected and the round should end when a previously selected card is chosen. This program is optimized for use with Google Chrome.

### Features

- Play area with randomized card order which shuffles after every turn and automatically resets when round ends
